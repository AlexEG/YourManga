          <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            King Grey has unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world
            governed by martial ability. <br />
            However, solitude lingers closely behind those with great power.
            <br />
            Beneath the glamorous exterior of a powerful king lurks the shell of
            man, devoid of purpose and will. <br />
            Reincarnated into a new world filled with magic and monsters, the
            king has a second chance to relive his life. <br />
            Correcting the mistakes of his past will not be his only challenge,
            however. <br />
            Underneath the peace and prosperity of the new world is an
            undercurrent threatening to destroy everything he has worked for,
            <br />
            questioning his role and reason for being born again.
