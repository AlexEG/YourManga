<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  King Grey has unrivaled strength, wealth, and prestige in a world
  governed by martial ability. <br />
  However, solitude lingers closely behind those with great power.
  <br />
  Beneath the glamorous exterior of a powerful king lurks the shell of
  man, devoid of purpose and will. <br />
  Reincarnated into a new world filled with magic and monsters, the
  king has a second chance to relive his life. <br />
  Correcting the mistakes of his past will not be his only challenge,
  however. <br />
  Underneath the peace and prosperity of the new world is an
  undercurrent threatening to destroy everything he has worked for,
  questioning his role and reason for being born again.
