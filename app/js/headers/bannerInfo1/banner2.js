<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
  All of a sudden, Miko is able to see grotesque monsters all around her; but no one else can. <br />
  Rather than trying to run away or face them, she instead musters all of her courage andâ€¦ ignores them.
  <br /> Join in on her day-to-day life as she keeps up her best poker face despite the supernatural goings-on.
