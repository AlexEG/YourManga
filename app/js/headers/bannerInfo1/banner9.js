<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Annoying! Cute! But Annoying!
Shinichi Sakurai is a grumpy-faced, athletic and quiet college student who just wants to be left alone,<br>
but he is frequently teased by his cute, stacked underclassman Hana Uzaki, who he has known since high school.<br>
Sugoi Dekai means something along the lines of "impressively huge."
