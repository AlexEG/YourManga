<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
She's as noisy as she is dumb. <br>
As the name implies, "Aho" Girl, or Dumb Girl, is as stupid as you can get.<br>
 Which is why her crush and childhood friend, Akuru Akutsu (or "Akkun" as everyone calls him), isn't the only one unwilling to put up with her fallacies. <br>
 Along the way, they are joined by many other fellow idiots as they probe deeper into the true meaning of idiocy, and the true relationship between Yoshiko and Akkun.
