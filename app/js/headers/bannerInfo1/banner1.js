<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    Tomo Aizawa was able to successfully confess to her crush
    Junichirou Kubota. <br />
    There is only one problem: He just sees her as his buddy. He
    thought that she was a boy until they went to middle school
    together, because her grade school was in a different school
    district.
