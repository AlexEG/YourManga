<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
Narumi Momose has had it rough: every boyfriend she’s had dumped her once they found out she was an otaku, <br> so she’s gone to great lengths to hide it. When a chance meeting at her new job with childhood friend, fellow otaku, and now coworker Hirotaka Nifuji almost gets her secret outed at work,<br> she comes up with a plan to make sure he never speaks up. But he comes up with a counter-proposal: why doesn’t she just date him instead? In love, there are no save points.
