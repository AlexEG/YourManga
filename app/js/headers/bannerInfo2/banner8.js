A young girl fights on the frontlines in war. She has blonde hair, blue eyes, and nearly transparent white skin as she flies through the air and mercilessly strikes down her enemies. Her name is Tanya Degurechaff and speaks with a young girl's lisp while she commands the army. Tanya used to be one of Japan's elite office workers, but because of a wrathful god was reborn as a little girl.
