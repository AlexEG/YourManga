<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
According to the god’s prophecy, the girl Flamm was chosen to be one of the members of the demon king’s subjugation journey. Everyone was a hero and possessed a top class power. However, for some reason only Flamm did not possess the power to fight, and all of her status values were 0. While being ashamed, she continued to put great efforts to be useful to the heroes.
