<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
After being soundly thrashed by the hero Emilia, the Devil King and his general beat a hasty retreat to a parallel universeâ€¦ only to land plop in the middle of bustling, modern-day Tokyo! Lacking the magic necessary to return home, the two are forced to assume human identities and live average human lives until they can find a better solution. And to make ends meet, Satan finds gainful employment at a nearby fast food joint! With his devilish mind set on working his way up the management food chain, what will become of his thirst for conquest?
